# Day 4: Randomisation and Python Lists 🎲📝

## 📘 What I Learned
- Using the `random` module to generate random outcomes
- Indexing and accessing elements in Python lists
- Appending and modifying list contents
- Understanding and avoiding IndexErrors
- Introduction to nested lists
- Designing basic interactive logic games

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- `random.choice()` for selecting elements from a list
- Creating and managing lists
- Validating user input to prevent runtime errors
- Using ASCII art for terminal-based UI

## 💡 Project Completed
### Rock Paper Scissors Game
A classic game implemented using:
- List-based mapping of visual ASCII art for each choice
- Randomized computer moves
- Conditional logic to determine game results
- Validation for invalid input values

### 🎮 Sample Playthrough
