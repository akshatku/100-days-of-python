# Day 5: Python Loops and Password Generator 🔁🔐

## 📘 What I Learned
- Using `for` loops to iterate over lists and ranges
- The `range()` function for generating sequences of numbers
- Implementing conditional logic inside loops
- Combining lists and loops to solve real-world problems
- Using `random.sample()` for secure, non-repeating random choices
- `random.shuffle()` and `''.join()` for combining list items into strings

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Looping through lists and ranges
- Generating random elements from a list
- Handling edge cases (like too many requested characters)
- Shuffling list contents
- Joining list items into a final string

## 💡 Project Completed
### PyPassword Generator
A customizable password generator that:
- Asks the user for number of letters, symbols, and digits
- Generates a random password containing all the requested characters
- Uses list shuffling to ensure randomness of order
- Includes input validation to handle extreme inputs

### 🔐 Sample Output
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator! 
How many letters would you like in your password? 4 
How many symbols would you like? 2 
How many numbers would you like? 3 
Your password is: 7eG&+9Ma3
