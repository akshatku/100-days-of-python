# Day 2: Understanding Data Types and Creating a Tip Calculator ðŸ’°

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- Python primitive data types: strings, integers, and floats
- Type checking and type conversion using `str()`, `int()`, `float()`
- Performing basic mathematical operations in Python
- Using `round()` and formatted strings (f-strings) for cleaner outputs

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered
- Type errors and how to handle them
- Mathematical expressions using operators
- Getting user input and converting data types
- Using f-strings for clean and readable output

## ðŸ’¡ Projects Completed
### Tip Calculator
A simple Python script that:
- Takes the total bill amount
- Asks for a tip percentage
- Splits the bill among a given number of people
- Outputs how much each person should pay, rounded to 2 decimal places

### ðŸ§¾ Example Output
Welcome to the tip calculator! 
What was the total bill? $100 
What percentage tip would you like to give? 12 
How many people to split the bill? 5 
Each person should pay: $22.4
