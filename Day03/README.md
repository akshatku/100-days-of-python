# Day 3: Control Flow and Logical Operators ðŸ§­

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for decision making
- Understanding logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Working with the modulo operator (`%`) to identify patterns
- Structuring nested conditionals
- Writing multi-branch condition logic
- Improving user experience with clean input handling (`.lower()` for normalization)

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered
- Control flow in Python
- Nested conditionals and multi-path logic
- Combining logical operators in decision chains
- Writing readable, maintainable game logic

## ðŸ’¡ Projects Completed
### Treasure Island Adventure Game
A text-based game where:
- Users make a series of decisions through typed input
- Outcomes depend on control flow logic
- The goal is to find a hidden treasure without encountering "Game Over" scenarios

### ðŸŽ® Sample Playthrough
You're at a crossroad, where do you want to go? left 
You've come to a lake... wait for a boat or swim? wait 
Which colour door do you choose? yellow 
You found the treasure. You Win!
